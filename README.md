## Dependencies

* yarn
* jest (Testing library)
* Nodejs 12

## Project structure

The project has two different submodules. One for each problem:

* non-constructible-change
* sorted-squared-array

Each module is independent and has its own functions to work. Each submodule has its own unit tests that runs using jest.

## Scripts

## Run

The project can run the two functions using a default testing value:

### Non constructible change

It uses this test case to run:

``` array = [5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22] ```

It can be run using the next script:

``` yarn run:change ```

The project has unit tests that can be run using the next script:

``` yarn test:change ```

### Sorted squared array

It uses this test case to run:

``` array = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9] ```

It can be run using the next script:

``` yarn run:sorted ```

The project has unit tests that can be run using the next script:

``` yarn test:sorted ```
